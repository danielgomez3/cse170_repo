  He was tasked with improving overall engineering after a crash.
- They were polar opposites and had a tense relationship.
- Even thought Terrence and his team wrote a lot of new code, they never
  really tested any of it. He never wanted to. He had outbursts every time he
  was questioned, he was too passionate.

  was scared. She has no clue what to do.
