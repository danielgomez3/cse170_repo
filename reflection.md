##### So What? (Reflect and Regroup)  
(5 points): What did I learn from the study material  
I learned that-- most importantly-- our beliefs and actions will make up our characteristics, and our characteristics will directly influence our success in the workplace.  
(5 points): Why is this week's topic important?  
This week's topic is important because success in the workplace relies heavily on making a good team, and in order to make a good team you need to be personable.  
(5 points): How did this week scenerio relate to the week’s topic?  
This week's scenario, as I mentioned earlier, related because we were able to personally apply and see where we were doing well and what attributes needed to be improved in order to be a good teamate.  
(5 points): What did you learn from your work on your project?  
I learned that I really struggled with sharing my thoughts and ideas with my teamates, and I need to do better at speaking up, and caring about what other people think about me. I learned that *it is* in fact important to have a good report with others.  

(5 points): What insights did your team lean from this week’s questions?  
We didn't form into teams this week...  
(5 points): What actions were assigned to you, in your team meeting?  
There were no actions, neither teams...  

##### 10 pts Questions Behavior: (What now?...my ideas are starting to emerge!)  
1 Points: What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week?  
The most significant take-a-way I gained was the influence of leading by actions. It wouldn't really matter how much I promised, or how much I would have to say, if my actions didn't align with my beliefs.  

1 Points: What do you do, steps, or processes related to this week's topic?  
I think currently I'm seeking to be more honest, competent, and more of a 'do-er' versus somebody who seeks the attention of others, and likes to waster time. I think setting a schedule on a calendar will allow me to carry out more actionable goals.  

1 Points: How would you explain this week's topics to a person not in this class?  
The way I would explain this week's topics: This week we learned about how to be powerful, and build more influence in the workplace. We learned that it stems from personality and our choice to be a good team member. Being a good team member requires work, and an honest attempt to hone those soft skills.  

1 Points: What did you learn by explaining this week's topic to someone not in this class?  
The person I explained this too help me realize the important that even though teamwork and relatability is a soft-skill, it's skill important to practice and hone it like you would any other hard-skill.


1 Points: Write a SMART goal for next week?  
My SMART goal for this week: get caught up on *all* of my classes and turn everything on-time this weekend. I can do so by working progressively Monday, Wednesday, and Friday my online classes, even though there's nothing to turn-in.  

1 Points: What would you do differently next week?  
I plan on being more accountable by doing those things first-thing in the morning, that way no matter what I will be able to better accomplish my goal.  

1 Points: What five take did you get from the scenerio?  
The five take I got from the scenario was by being more conscious about how I speak and interact with my teamates. Cooperation is key when it comes to being productive: software and computers in general are becoming too great to know it all, so it's important to divide that work as teams.  

1 Points: How does the weekly topic relate to the MIM model?  
Our weekly topic relates to the MIM model because what our beliefs actions, and other internal things may be, it will reflect the way we behave and ultimately how much of an impact we make in the workplace.  

##### 20 pts Questions Cognitive: (Wow, I learn?... Ok that is deep!)  
Why is this week's topic important for teamwork?  
This week's topic is important for teamwork because what we do personally-- such as community work, maintaining relationships, and conduct-- we allow ourselves to hone our team skills.  
How do plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?  
I plan on contributing to the team by asking about their personal lives, commenting their appearance, finding 'the one' topic that we might be able to relate to, and overall anything small but important in order to make an impact to our team.  
How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had?  
I can recall a time being a member of scouts, and not caring about having a good report, and would often order and command people to do things versus being a good team member. My effectiveness was not great at all. Had I learned MIM, I would know that my interaction and conduct needs to be positive in order to have an influence in the workplace.  
How does your experience relate to other classmates’ experiences?  
Although we didn't exactly get to share many specific expeiences in Wednesday's class one classmate during our class-time shared a similar experience to mine where they could have done better in being a more agreeable and friendly person.  

Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn, that they didn’t know before?  
They seemed to know and internalize everything pretty well, but one thing they really seemed to enjoy talking about was that our beliefs could reflect outward.  

If you were to write your experience as STAR story, how would you phrase it?  
"I can recall an experience in high-school where I wasn't exactly learned in the importance of the MIM model, and being personable. So I recall a time on my full-time proselyting mission where I was called to leadership. Knowing that I had previously failed, I sought to build relationships, watch my tone, and apologize when I didn't deliver the right information needed. I sought to be consistent. I sought out to be honest. As a result, I had much success, I was told I was the favorite, and there was an overall positive experience for everyone, including me."  

If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week’s topic to the gospel?  
I would relate this to our hearts. If our hearts and our thoughts are dark, unproductive, or maybe even based on negative thoughts toward our teamates, then our works will be likewise. They will reflect themselves into what we do.
