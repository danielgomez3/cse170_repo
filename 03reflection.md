So What? (Reflect and Regroup)  
What did I learn from the study material  
This week I learned more about personalities and how each of our personalities played a role in our roles in th workplace. I took the myer-briggs test and scored as a logistician, or ISTJ-A.  

Why is this week's topic important?  
It's important to understand personality, because understanding one's personality can allow us to modify our behavior at work or know what to expect in a certain field or workplace. For example, if we are of a more extroverted personality, then we can expect to look into fields that might better suit our social needs.

What actions were assigned to you, in your team meeting?

10 pts Questions Behavior: (What now?...my ideas are starting to emerge!)
What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week?  
My most significant take-a-way that I gained was that knowing our personalities are important because it can show us what we are most-likely and naturally equipped to do.  

What do you do, steps, or processes related to this week's topic?  
I practice self-awareness by reflecting on my thoughts at the end of the day. If I find myself in a frustrating situation, or if over-stressed, than I plan on stopping what I'm saying or where I'm at, calm myself, and think about the things I plan on saying before I do it.  

How would you explain this week's topics to a person not in this class?  
'Personality is something everyone has, and everyone uniquely experiences. Mindfulness allows us to understand how we behave, and later our behavior to better fit-in with our environment without compromising our morals'  

What did you learn by explaining this week's topic to someone not in this class?  
I learned that even though personality and mindfulness is a topic that everyone (including me) might have felt experienced in, there's a lot of depth and practice involved. 

Write a SMART goal for next week?  
My SMART goal: Attend all meetings and complete at least one module for the cybersecurity society on campus  

What would you do differently next week?  
Next week I think I will attempt to join or at least attend another society like database design in order to familiarize myself with topics I might have more interest in  

What five take did you get from the scenerio?  
Everyone feels like an expert in understanding their personality, even if it might not be true.  

How does the weekly topic relate to the MIM model?  
Self-Consciousness ties really well with mindfulness, and I'd even go far as to say that they are synonyms. The more mindfull we are of our beliefs, this will translate to our changing our habits and interactions with others, to be turned into a positive.  

20 pts Questions Cognitive: (Wow, I learn?... Ok that is deep!)  
Why is this week's topic important for teamwork?  
This week's topic is important for teamwork because our cooperation an interactions with others will determine if we are a good fit for a job.  

How do plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?
I think this week I will plan on assessing the personality types of my teamates and see how I can play to their strengths.  

How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had?  
I can relate to the times in my previous employment where I wasn't very mindful. By not being mindful, I tended to make more mistakes, and couldn't learn from them versus the times I was mindful and achieved more sucess.  

How does your experience relate to other classmates’ experiences?  
One classmate shared his experience working as a security guard, and met some people who weren't as very meticulous as he was, so it was hard to work with them as much as the other groups.  

Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn, that they didn’t know before?  
One experience I can recall is when I taught someone about what we learned, they brought up the fact that everone is more of an agreeable person than they actually are. This allowed me to humble myself and focus more on my weaknesses. This led my team to follow my example and acknowledge their weaknesses, and thus from this experience we were able to grow closer together from that humility.  

If you were to write your experience as STAR story, how would you phrase it?
If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week’s topic to the gospel?  
I would phrase it like 'Humility breeds excellence'. If you think about it, this relates well with the saviors example. If we follow his example and humble ourselves, we can learn and grow a lot more.
